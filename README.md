1. Using bootstrap changed my coding experience, by making lots of open source code easy to access and use to use on my own projects. This saves me lots of time and effort, which can be put into other parts of the project.

2. I was able to follow very closely to my MVP plan, from using the fonts I wanted to use, the cards I wanted, the carousel and the overall design and business idea. 

3. The features that I am most proud of is the carousel because it is something I used to have trouble on but this time it was pretty straightforward and easy to use. 

4. What I would add if I had more time was interactive aspects to my website such as redirect link, hovering stuff, and more centering/overall color designs
